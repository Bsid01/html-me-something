                <p>My family and I took a roadtrip down to Destin, Fl.
                On the way there we passed through a few different states
                and saw different things.
                Here is some information about the places we visited.</p>

                    <p>The first major place we 
                    went to on our way to Florida was Nashville, Tennessee.
                    The traffic was horrible, and there was a lot of people
                    traveling on the outskirts of the city. Beside all of the
                    people, the city itself was really nice.</p>

                    <p>Next up, there were two major cities we came to in our long journey.
                    The first city was birmingham, and the second was Montgomery, the capitol.
                    These cities are similar to Nashville which means they're bigger than any 
                    other city in the state, and they also have a lot of people.</p>
