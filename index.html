                <p>My family and I took a roadtrip down to Destin, Fl.
                On the way there we passed through a few different states
                and saw different things.
                Here is some information about the places we visited.</p>

            <p>The first major place we 
            went to on our way to Florida was Nashville, Tennessee.
            The traffic was horrible, and there was a lot of people
            traveling on the outskirts of the city. Beside all of the
            people, the city itself was really nice.</p>
