                    <p>My family and I took a roadtrip down to Destin, Fl.
                    On the way there we passed through a few different states
                    and saw different things.
                    Here is some information about the places we visited.</p>

                    <p>The first major place we 
                    went to on our way to Florida was Nashville, Tennessee.
                    The traffic was horrible, and there was a lot of people
                    traveling on the outskirts of the city. Beside all of the
                    people, the city itself was really nice.</p>

                    <p>Next up, there were two major cities we came to in our long journey.
                    The first city was birmingham, and the second was Montgomery, the capitol.
                    These cities are similar to Nashville which means they're bigger than any 
                    other city in the state, and they also have a lot of people.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Finally, after 7 hours of travel down south,
                    we made it to our destination which was Miramar Beach, Florida.
                    I've been to Florida once in the past, however I stayed at a
                    different part in the state. In short, Miramar Beach has quite a bit to offer. 
                    If one doesn't eat sea food very often, there are some great places like whalestail
                    that that they might enjoy. As for entertainment there's a boardwalk carnival, 
                    dolphin cruises, the ocean to swim in, and various stores in the area. 
                    After visiting Florida for a second time, I would recommend visiting the beautiful state
                    for anyone looking for a nice vacation.</p>
